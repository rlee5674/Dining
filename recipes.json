//Some Important notes:::
//Do not confuse Key_Ing with Full or Steps.
//Key_Ing will only include ingredients that change daily. These tend to be the 
//the food items that are specifically mentioned. Key_Ing will not mention the items that are always 
//in dining halls (ex: there is always  deli section so there is always cheese, jam, etc. 
//There is always salad bar, so there is always cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, soy sauce, etc.). 
//You use Key_Ing for sorting purposes so this is more for Janny's page. 
//
//Full is the full list of all the ingredients (including those that weren't listed in Menu_Ingredients
//because we know they are always available but the dining menu API doesn't mention them). This is what is printed
//on the screen when Camille does her recipe elaboration page
//
//Steps is how to create the dish. This should mostly only concern Camille.
//RecNum is also for Camille. It's how many times someone recommends a recipe. Default is 0

//Genre categories [TO START for now; can change later]: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert
//Possibilities: Vegetarian, Desserts, Noodles, Sandwiches, Salads
